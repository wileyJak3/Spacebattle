## Description:

  This is a java script space battle video game that uses alert and prompts. 

## Features:
   
### - Bonuses:
   - Implemented: The aliens send a random number of ships to attack Earth. Think of a reasonable range and implement it. 
     Functional, but hardcoded.

  -  Implemented: Scientists have developed a super targeting computer for your lasers. You now are asked which of the aliens you would like to hit with your            lasers. 

  - Implemented: Scientists have improved your ship's shields. They don't work that consistently, and only improve your hit points by a random number each time 
 
  - Implemented: Scientists have put missiles on your ship. You only have a limited number of them, but they do a lot of damage. You can say before each battle if       you want to use one of your missles. Missiles amount is randomized.
  
### - Bonus Bonus:
  
  - Implemented: When the game is over, prompt the user if they would like to play again, and make it so the user can play again with all the values set back to         default. 
  
## How to play:
  Enter the prompted user inputs to proceed through the game. "Normal Mode" is completed by defeating six ships and "Bonus Mode" is completed by destroying a         random number of ships
